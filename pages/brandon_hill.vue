            Brandon Hill

          <p>
            Brandon Hill is the highest mountain in County Kilkenny. It has an
            elevation of 515 m (1,690 ft). It is situated 4 kilometers
            South-South-West of Graignamanagh, 7 kilometers east of Inistioge
            and 11 kilometers east of Thomastown, in the south of County
            Kilkenny. Brandon Hill is in the barony of Gowran and in the
            province of Leinster. The village of Graignamanagh is at the base of
            the hill.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            It is the termination of the chain of granitic mountains that raise
            from the shores of Dublin bay. The base of Brandon Hill on the side
            of the River Barrow and the hill running to Graig is composed of
            schist rock. This blackish siliceous schistus, sometimes containing
            grains of quartz and when it is broken it has a shivery texture and
            is hard enough to scratch glass. There are a few beds of marble and
            limestone gravel near the foot of the mountain.
